# Rejuvenate - Dead Repositories Revived by the Community

Many repositories suffer from absence of the original maintainer / the owner and are **technically dead**.
With that, open Issues and Pull-Requests are effectively useless as they are never answered/merged, and forks with separate small/important changes are not considered or distinguishable as the successors of the project.

**Dying repositories** are a very sad and disappointing sight on GitHub.

Owners or Collaborators of repositories can vanish at any point.
Open source projects shouldn't suffer from that.
These projects live from the contribution and ongoing improvement by many individuals and should not be strictly depended on a single person.

**"Rejuvenate"** is a community to host and maintain **Revived Repositories**.
The members of the organization are a group of open source developers without relations to GitHub, Inc.

## How Rejuvenation Works

*WIP*

We respect the original developers of projects.
A repository/project is considered to be *rejuvenated*, only if the owner/maintainer of the original project hasn't answered Issues and Pull Requests for longer times.

1. [Open an Issue here](https://github.com/rejuvenate/rejuvenate/issues), asking us to create a fork
2. We will check the repository and create a fork under [https://github.com/rejuvenate](https://github.com/rejuvenate)
3. You and every interested user will receive [elevated permissions](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) for the repository
4. The *rejuvenate* community is henceforth in charge to manage the project fork, issues and pull requests

The new *rejuvenated* "community repository" will empower the community to keep the project alive.

**All actions in this organization follow the rules of the licenses projects were released under.
Contributions stay the intellectual property of the respective authors.**

## How Will the Community Repository be Maintained?

*WIP*

The idea is to authorize individuals to make or propose changes to the repository in the best interest of the community.
This includes discussions of new ideas or bug reports through issues, merging of pull requests, etc.

Contributions to the main branch of a project must happen through Pull Requests.
The Pull Requests will allow other community members to be notified and to add reviews with suggestions and criticism.

## How to Advertise the Community Repository?

Open an Issue and comment on Pull Requests in the original repository to make other users aware of the *rejuvenated* repository.
