# Rejuvenate - Dead Repositories Revived by the Community

Many repositories suffer from absence of the original maintainer / the owner and are **technically dead**.
With that, open Issues and Pull-Requests are effectively useless as they are never answered/merged, and forks with separate small/important changes are not considered or distinguishable as the successors of the project.

**Dying repositories** are a very sad and disappointing sight on GitHub.

Owners or Collaborators of repositories can vanish at any point.
Open source projects shouldn't suffer from that.
These projects live from the contribution and ongoing improvement by many individuals and should not be strictly depended on a single person.

**"Rejuvenate"** is an organization to host and maintain **Revived Repositories**. The members of the organization are a group of open source developers without relations to GitHub, Inc.

## How Rejuvenation Works

*The following is work in progress!*

We respect the original developers of projects.
A repository/project is suited to be *rejuvenated*, only if the owner/maintainer of the original project hasn't answered Issues and Pull Requests for more than six months.

1. [Open an Issue here](https://github.com/rejuvenate/rejuvenate/issues), asking us to create a fork
2. We will check the repository and create a fork under [https://github.com/rejuvenate](https://github.com/rejuvenate)
3. You and the original developer will receive [Write permissions](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization)

The new *rejuvenated* "community repository" will empower the community to keep the project alive.

**All projects and contributions stay the intellectual property of the respective authors.
All actions in this organization follow the rules of the licenses projects were released under.
Never will the git history of repositories be altered.**

## How Will the Community Repository be Maintained?

All repositories rely on a voting system to authorize individuals to make changes to the repository, merge pull requests, create branches, etc.

## How to Advertise the Community Repository?

Open an Issue and comment on Pull Requests in the original repository to make other users aware of the *rejuvenated* repository.
